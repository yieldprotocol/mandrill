We need to calculate the total amount of energy usage and the amount of renewable energy usage for each city, then calculate the percentage.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can break it down into two steps:\n\n1. We will calculate the total energy usage for each city. This can be done by selecting the city_id and summing the amount_used from the energy_usage table and grouping by city_id.\n2. After having the total amount, we will calculate the total renewable energy usage for each city. The source_type indicates whether the energy is renewable or not. We need to sum the amount_used where source_type is 'renewable' and group by city_id.\n3. By having these two numbers, we can calculate the percentage of renewable energy usage for each city by dividing the renewable amount by the total amount.\n\nLet's perform the first step.\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT city_id, SUM(amount_used) as total_energy FROM energy_usage GROUP BY city_id;\n```"}, {"from": "human", "value": "[('1', '5000'), ('2', '10000'), ('3', '7500'), ('4', '6000')]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "These are the total amount of energy used by each city.

Here is the SQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT total.city_id, renewable.renewable_energy / total.total_energy * 100 as percentage\nFROM \n    (SELECT city_id, SUM(amount_used) as total_energy FROM energy_usage GROUP BY city_id) as total\nJOIN \n    (SELECT city_id, SUM(amount_used) as renewable_energy FROM energy_usage WHERE source_type = 'renewable' GROUP BY city_id) as renewable\nON total.city_id = renewable.city_id;\n```\n\nThis SQL statement creates two subqueries: one for the total energy usage per city, and one for the renewable energy usage per city. It then joins these subqueries on the city_id, and for each city it calculates the percentage of energy that comes from renewable sources.\n\nHowever, we can't execute this SQL in our current environment.

The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table. \n\nHere's how it generally works:\n\n```\nUPDATE table_name\nSET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...\nWHERE condition;\n```\n\nHere, `table_name` is the name of the table where we want to update data. `column1, column2,...` are the names of the columns that we want to update. `value1, value2,...` are the new values with which we want to update the data. The `WHERE` clause specifies which record or records that should be updated. If we omit the WHERE clause, all records will be updated.\n\nIn this case, we want to update the 'OrderStatus' field to 'Archived' in the 'orders_archive' table where the 'OrderDate' is before 2018. Let's do this using the UPDATE statement.\n\nHere is the SQL statement we will use for this operation:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE orders_archive SET OrderStatus = 'Archived' WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) < 2018;\n```\n\nThis statement will update the 'OrderStatus' to 'Archived' for all records in the 'orders_archive' table where the year of 'OrderDate' is less than 2018.

We can solve it in two steps. \n\nFirst, we need to find the courses that haven't been offered in the last two years. This involves comparing the LastOfferedDate of each course against the date two years ago from the current date. \n\nSecond, we need to cross-reference the courses we found with the enrollment_records table to find the ones that had an enrollment of over 100 students. We accomplish this by joining the 'course_catalog' table with the 'enrollment_records' table on the CourseID column, which is common to both tables. \n\nLet's start with the first operation: finding the courses that haven't been offered in the last two years. \n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CourseID, Title FROM course_catalog WHERE LastOfferedDate < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR);\n```"}, {"from": "human", "value": "[]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "The result indicates that there are no courses that haven't been offered in the last two years.\n\nHowever, to fulfill the second part of the initial task, let's proceed and find courses with enrollment count greater than 100.\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT CourseID FROM enrollment_records WHERE EnrollmentCount > 100;\n```"}, {"from": "human", "value": "[]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "The result indicates that there are no courses with an enrollment count of over 100 students.\n\nWith these two results, we can conclude that no courses meet the criteria of not having been offered in the last two years and having an enrollment of over 100 students.\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: []"}]
