We need to identify the invoices that are from December 2020 and have a 'Total' value of less than 1000.\n\nTo do this, we can use the SQL's `DELETE` command. This command allows us to delete data that meets certain criteria from a table.\n\nIn this case, we will be using it with a `WHERE` clause which will specify that the date of the invoice should be in December 2020 and the total should be less than 1000.\n\nWe can isolate the month and year from the Date field by using MySQL's `MONTH()` and `YEAR()` functions. The `MONTH()` function will return the month part of the Date as an integer (1-12), and the `YEAR()` function will return the year part.\n\nPlease be aware that this operation will permanently remove the matched records from your database.\n\nLet's make the SQL command:\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM invoices WHERE MONTH(Date) = 12 AND YEAR(Date) = 2020 AND Total < 1000;\n```"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.07 sec)"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Action: Answer\nFinal Answer: This action doesn't have a specific answer.
