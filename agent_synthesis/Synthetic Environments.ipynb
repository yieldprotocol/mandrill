For flight bookings, it will return information like flight number, airline, departure time, arrival time, price, available seats, etc. For hotel bookings, it could return information like hotel name, location, price per night, available rooms, amenities, etc. For restaurant bookings, it could return information like restaurant name, location, available seats, menu, pricing, etc. Furthermore, it could return statuses of adjusted reservations and booking statuses.\\n\\nInputs: The input format could be a specifically structured JSON request. The JSON request should have fields specifying the type of reservation (flight, hotel, restaurant), criteria for the reservation such as dates, number of people, location (for hotel and restaurant), destination (for flight), budget, preferred timings, dietary restrictions (for restaurant), room type (for hotel), etc. Additionally, there should be options to input requests for adjusting current reservations and also for monitoring the status of a specific booking. The agent should be able to input natural language queries, which will be processed to adjust the JSON request accordingly. \\n\\nFor example, a JSON request for a hotel booking could look something like this:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \"reservation_type\": \"hotel\",\\n  \"location\": \"New York\",\\n  \"check_in_date\": \"2022-10-01\",\\n  \"check_out_date\": \"2022-10-10\",\\n  \"number_of_people\": 2,\\n  \"room_type\": \"double_bed\",\\n  \"budget\": 1500,\\n  \"amenities\": [\"wifi\", \"breakfast\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd a corresponding JSON response could look something like this:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \"booking_options\": [{\\n      \"hotel_name\": \"The Grand New York\",\\n      \"location\": \"Central Park West, New York\",\\n      \"price_per_night\": 150,\\n      \"available_rooms\": 5,\\n      \"amenities\": [\"wifi\", \"breakfast\", \"spa\", \"gym\"],\\n      \"total_price\": 1350\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"hotel_name\": \"The Plaza Hotel\",\\n      \"location\": \"Fifth Avenue, New York\",\\n      \"price_per_night\": 200,\\n      \"available_rooms\": 3,\\n      \"amenities\": [\"wifi\", \"breakfast\", \"pool\", \"gym\"],\\n      \"total_price\": 1800\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```',\n",
