      "\n",
      "Here's the why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. There are no records in the `person` table for the advisor IDs (`p_id_dummy`) mentioned in the `advisedBy` table. So we don't have any information about the advisors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The `student` and `professor` columns in the `person` table seem to hold names instead of a boolean flag to differentiate between a student and professor. Hence, we can't distinguish between students and professors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The `hasPosition` column in the `person` table holds the position name instead of a boolean flag indicating whether a person has a faculty position or not. So we can't identify the professors with a faculty position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of these reasons, we can't construct the SQL query based on the current schema and data to get the desired output. \n",
      "\n",
      "To resolve these issues, we could alter the schema of the `person` table to include boolean flags for `student`, `professor`, and `hasPosition` fields. Also, the `advisedBy` table should have valid advisor IDs that are present in the `person` table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once these changes are done, we can join the `person` and `advisedBy` table on `p_id` and `p_id_dummy` respectively, and apply the conditions to filter out the results for students in their 8th year and professors with a faculty position.\n",

      "1. The identifiers of the advisors in the `advisedBy` table (`p_id_dummy`) do not correspond to any identifiers in the `person` table (`p_id`).  \n",

      "The ideal solution would be to correct the provided data so that the `p_id_dummy` values in the `advisedBy` table match the `p_id` values in the `person` table, and to clarify the data structure in the `person` table to identify students, professors, and faculty positions.\n",
