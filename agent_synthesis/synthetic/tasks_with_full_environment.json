Informational outputs: This would include notifications, alerts, or other status updates about the refinery operations. For instance, an alert might be sent when a piece of equipment is running outside its specified range, or when maintenance is required. These could be output in plain text format, for easier parsing by the agent. For example, \"Alert: Boiler1 is overheating. Current temperature: 200C\".\n\nInputs: The inputs to the Refinery Control Simulator could be Commands in the form of JSON objects that specify actions to be taken. Each command would correspond to a specific operation that can be performed in the refinery, such as adjusting a valve, calibrating a piece of equipment, or initiating a shutdown procedure. For instance, {\"Command\": \"AdjustValve\", \"ValveID\": \"v101\", \"Adjustment\": \"Increase\", \"Amount\": \"10%\"} or {\"Command\": \"Calibrate\", \"EquipmentID\": \"b201\"}. \n\nEach command would inherently need to be valid and within the allowable operations of the refinery control system.

It might also support commands for running different extraction strategies or algorithms, such as water flooding or gas injection, and for adjusting the parameters of these strategies. \n\nThe input format could also include a mechanism for the AI agent to ask questions or request clarifications about the simulation parameters or strategies. This could be in the form of a natural language query, which the simulation environment would attempt to answer based on its current state and available data. For more complex queries, the input format could support a form of scripting or programming, allowing the AI agent to set up and run custom analysis or optimization tasks.",

This summary could be based on an aggregation of the category impacts using a weighting system that reflects the priorities of the environmentalist.\n\nInputs: The input will be a YAML file. This file will include sections to define the project's details, such as the project type, duration, location, involved materials, processes, and energy sources. These sections will be organized hierarchically to maintain clarity and simplicity.\n\nEach section will include relevant parameters that the AI can analyze. For example, the energy section could detail the types of energy sources used, total energy consumption, and duration of energy use. The materials section could define the type and quantity of materials used, their sourcing (recycled or virgin), and end-of-life disposition (recyclable, compostable, landfill, etc.).\n\nThe YAML file will also include a section to specify the weights for different environmental impact categories based on the environmentalist's priorities. This will allow users to customize the environmental impact analysis according to their specific concerns.\n\nInitial Capabilities Displayed by the Environmental Impact Analyzer:\nSET_PROJECT_DETAILS: Set details of the project to be evaluated.\nSET_PRIORITY_WEIGHTS: Set the weights for different environmental impact categories.\nANALYZE_IMPACT: Execute the environmental impact analysis.\nSHOW_IMPACT: Display the estimated environmental impact.\nASK_QUESTION: Pose a natural language question about capabilities.",
