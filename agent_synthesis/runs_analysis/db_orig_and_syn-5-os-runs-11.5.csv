3. If you think you have got the answer to the question, take answer action, and you should print like this:

Think: put your thought here.

Act: answer(Your answer to the question should be put in this pair of parentheses)

If the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself. Attention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should take only exact one of the three actions in each turn.
