{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "## Environment Overview\nThe city environment is a grid-based layout with streets and sidewalks for navigation, various buildings, and diverse objects such as trash cans, benches, traffic signals, and streetlights. The robot operates primarily on the sidewalks but has to occasionally cross streets at designated crosswalks while obeying traffic signals. Buildings can occasionally be entered, with doorways that can be interacted with. There are areas designated for different activities, like parks with objects that can be picked up or put down, and zones marked for robot recharging. Other dynamic entities, such as pedestrians, vehicles, and animals, move in the environment and the robot must navigate around them, ensuring safe and respectful interaction.\n\n## Actions\n```json\n{\n  \"move_forward\": \"The robot advances in the direction it is currently facing.\",\n  \"turn_left\": \"The robot rotates 90 degrees to its left.\",\n  \"turn_right\": \"The robot rotates 90 degrees to its right.\",\n  \"pick_up\": \"The robot picks up an object within its reach.\",\n  \"put_down\": \"The robot places a held object down in the designated location.\",\n  \"interact\": \"The robot performs a general interaction with objects or interfaces in the environment (e.g., press a button, open a door).\"\n}\n```\n\n## Task\nCollect trash from street bins and transport it to the central waste disposal area. The robot is to find and pick up trash from bins located at each street corner, ensuring no garbage is left around the bins, and then put down the collected trash at the designated waste area situated on the outskirts of the city layout.\n\n## Current State\nRobot's Current Position: At the northwest corner of 5th Avenue and Main Street, facing east on the sidewalk. A green street bin marked for recyclables is directly in front of the robot, approximately 1 meter away. Two pedestrians are walking towards the robot on the same sidewalk, about 5 meters away. The street to the robot's south is a two-lane road with a line of parked cars separating the traffic lane from the curb, the closest parked car is 3 meters to the right and 2 meters forward from the robot's current position. There's a streetlight stationed on the robot's left side, roughly 10 meters away. The intersection behind the robot has a traffic signal that currently shows green for the traffic flowing perpendicular to the robot's orientation. There's a coffee shop with an outdoor seating area immediately to the robot's left, with the closest table being about 4 meters from the robot's position. The central waste disposal area is located towards the east, at the end of Main Street, approximately 500 meters from the robot. The next street bin is 50 meters ahead on the same sidewalk, and there are several others at subsequent street corners. No immediate safety hazards are visible to the robot in its current field of view.\n\n## Stopping Criteria\n\"All designated street bins successfully emptied and contents transported to the central waste disposal area.
