BEGINEXAMPLE
I'm in the mood for a fun story, and I've got a few things in mind that I'd like you to include. Can you write me a tale set in a small coastal village? I'd love it if there was a talking cat who's wise beyond its years, and maybe it's guiding the main character to find an ancient key. The key could have some sort of mystical power or history. All of the characters should be female.  Feel free to take it in any direction you want, but make sure to include those elements.
