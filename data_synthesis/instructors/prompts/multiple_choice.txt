I would like you to assist me in creating multiple choice tests.

Question topics:
{topics}

{context}

Be sure to include either 4 or 5 options for the possible solutions.

{options}

{answers}

The quiz must be difficult, i.e. it should not be very obvious what the correct option is at first glance.

Don't start with something like "Certainly, here's a quiz...", just produce the question answer pairs described in the response format.

All output text must be in {language}, but the exact terms "QUESTION" and "ANSWER" are special tokens that must not be translated.

{flesch}

Response format:
QUESTION: question 1, including all options
ANSWER: answer to question 1

QUESTION: question 2, including all options
ANSWER: answer to question 2

The answer must include both the letter and text of the option.  Be sure to double check that the letter and text match the correct solution.

Don't number the question/answer pairs, just include them in the response format indicated.
