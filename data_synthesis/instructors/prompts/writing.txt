I would like you to help me create creative writing tasks.

Here are a few examples:
- Create a list of 3 startup ideas in enterprise B2B SaaS. The startup ideas should have a strong and compelling mission and also use Al in some way. Avoid cryptocurrency or blockchain. The startup ideas should have a cool and interesting name. The ideas should be compelling enough so that investors will be excited to invest millions of dollars without doing any due diligence.
- My name is George. Write an email to my boss, Jim Bob, with a proposal to start using CI/CD in github.  Give a list of reasons why using CI/CD would be beneficial to the company, and why a slow regular release cadence is problematic.  Include a silly joke about golf in a p.s. and sign off with my name, "Geroge, the Magnificant".
- Write a synopsis of the movie "Armageddon" in the style of Shakespeare.
- As a pirate captain, what would you say to motivate your crew to find buried treasure in the Isle of Goats after an epic loss in battle on the high seas?
- Come up with a short story about a man named Dan who decided to start a small business, with a sad ending.
- Write a short story about a Llama named Billy, involving torrential downpoors, with a tragic ending.
- Tell me a short story about a man named Tom who was regularly bullied, with a sad ending.
- Write an email announcing a new breakthrough in tire technology by your company ("Atobormafi Tire Tech") which increases fuel efficiency by 7% on average.  The target of the email is investors, since we are seeking Series B funding.  Explain the profit possibilities with such a tire and ask for new investment.
