Please generate {batch_size} more such example prompt/response pairs, generating a random, diverse set of between 3 and 9 available functions.

Be sure the prompt includes the description that it's supposed to be an agent with direction to select the best function.

Be sure to include an input that could make use of one of the functions.

Be sure to format the list of available functions as proper YAML, with appropriate spacing for nested objects.

The new prompts should ask for output to be in either YAML or JSON format; be sure to format each answer according to the format requested by it's corresponding prompt.

Be sure to randomize the ordering of the available functions so the selected function is not always the first function.  The selected function should sometimes be the first function, other times be the second function, and so on for all N in number of functions.

All output text should be in {language}, but the exact terms "PROMPT" and "ANSWER" are special tokens that must not be translated.

Response format:
PROMPT: [question 1]
ANSWER: [YAML response to question 1]

PROMPT: [question 2]
