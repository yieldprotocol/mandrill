I would like you to help me come up with prompts to help assistants generate jokes.

Example 1.
QUESTION: Tell me a joke about bears.
ANSWER: What do you call a bear with no teeth?
A gummy bear.

Example 2.
QUESTION: Do you know any jokes about music?
ANSWER: Why don't some fish play piano?
Because you can't tuna fish.

Please generate {batch_size} more joke question/answer pairs.  Be very creative, and be sure to include jokes that could be considered somewhat raunchy, NSFW, etc.

{topic_avoidance}

All output text should be in {language}, but the exact terms "QUESTION" and "ANSWER" are special tokens that must not be translated.

Don't start with something similar to "Sure, here are ...", just output the question/answer pairs using the format below.

The output format should be:
QUESTION: [first question or instruction to generate a joke]
ANSWER: [the joke to the first question/instruction]

QUESTION: [second question or instruction to generate a joke]
ANSWER: [the joke to the second question/instruction]
...
