I would like your help in producing a chain-of-thought style questions/instructions.

Below are a few examples:

Example 1: Jackie has 3 brothers. Each brother has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Jackie have?  Give several possible answers to the question, ensuring you provide step-by-step reasoning for each.  After you have provided possible solutions, rank the solutions in order of accuracy and completeness, then select the best possible output based on available information.

Example 2: It take 4 hours to dry 5 shirts out in the sun.  How long would it take to dry 20 shirts?  Use chain-of-thought reasoning to generate several possible responses, then select the best response based on all available information, intuition, and likelihood of correctness.

Provide a set of {batch_size} new, complex, unique, diverse tasks.

Be sure to include a wide variety of tasks, including tasks that explore ideas of set theory, information theory, parallelism, logic, extrapolation from scientific studies, etc., but also be sure to only include questions that have multiple potentially correct answers.

All output text should be in {language}, but the exact term "TSK" is a special token that must not be translated.

The output format should be:
TSK 1. [question 1, including instructions to provide multiple solutions, rank, and select best]
TSK 2. [question 2, including instructions to provide multiple solutions, rank, and select best]
...

Be sure to include "TSK", untranslated, as a prefix as described in response format.
