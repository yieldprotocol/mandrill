We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nUsing the point (5, 16.94) and the slope we found (0.99):\n\n16.94 - y1 = 0.99(5 - x1)\n\nNow we need to solve for y1:\n\n16.94 - y1 = 4.95\ny1 = 16.94 - 4.95\ny1 = 11.99\n\nNow we have both the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b), so we can write the function for the total shipping charge f(x) in dollars for an order with a merchandise weight of x pounds:\n\nf(x) = 0.99x + 11.99\n\nThe correct answer is (B) f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

The vertex of a parabola in the form $$y = a(x - h)^2 + k$$ is at the point $(h, k)$. To find the vertex of the given equation, we need to rewrite it in this form.\n\nGiven equation: $$y = a(x - 2)(x + 4)$$\n\nTo rewrite it in the vertex form, we need to expand the equation and complete the square.\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\n$$y = a(x^2 + 4x - 2x - 8)$$\n$$y = a(x^2 + 2x - 8)$$\n\nNow, let's complete the square:\n\n1. Divide the coefficient of the x term (2) by 2, and then square the result: $$(\\frac{2}{2})^2 = 1^2 = 1$$\n\n2. Add and subtract this value inside the parentheses:\n\n$$y = a(x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1 - 8)$$\n\n3. Rewrite the quadratic expression as a square:\n\n$$y = a((x + 1)^2 - 9)$$\n\nNow, the equation is in the vertex form: $$y = a(x - (-1))^2 - 9a$$\n\nThe vertex of the parabola is at the point $(-1, -9a)$. Therefore, the value of $d$ is equal to $-9a$.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) $-9a$.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

First, we need to find the number of students in Mr. Camp's class who have at least two siblings. We can do this by multiplying the total number of students in the class (26) by the percentage of students who have at least two siblings (34.6%).\n\n26 * 0.346 = 8.996 ≈ 9 students\n\n2. Now, we need to find the number of students in Mr. Camp's class who have fewer than two siblings. We can do this by subtracting the number of students with at least two siblings (9) from the total number of students in the class (26).\n\n26 - 9 = 17 students\n\n3. Next, we need to find the percentage of students in Mr. Camp's class who have fewer than two siblings. We can do this by dividing the number of students with fewer than two siblings (17) by the total number of students in the class (26).\n\n17 / 26 ≈ 0.654 ≈ 65.4%\n\n4. Now, we need to find the total number of eighth-grade students in the state. We can do this by multiplying the average eighth-grade class size (26) by the number of eighth-grade classes in the state (1,800).\n\n26 * 1,800 = 46,800 students\n\n5. Finally, we need to find the number of eighth-grade students in the state who have fewer than two siblings. We can do this by multiplying the total number of eighth-grade students in the state (46,800) by the percentage of students who have fewer than two siblings (65.4%).\n\n46,800 * 0.654 ≈ 30,595.2 ≈ 30,600 students\n\nSo, the best estimate for the number of eighth-grade students in the state who have fewer than two siblings is 30,600 (Choice C).\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

The perimeter of the base is determined using the width and length of the box. If a box has a height of 60 inches and its length is 2.5 times the width, which inequality shows the allowable width $x$, in inches, of the box? Answer Choices: (A)$0<x \\leq 10$ (B)$0<x \\leq 11 \\frac{2}{3}$ (C)$0<x \\leq 17 \\frac{1}{2}$ (D)$0<x \\leq 20$\nLet's think step by step.\nFirst, we need to find the perimeter of the base of the box. Since the length is 2.5 times the width, we can represent the length as 2.5x. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width). In this case, the perimeter P = 2(2.5x + x).\n\nNow, we know that the sum of the perimeter of the base and the height of the box cannot exceed 130 inches. So, we can write the inequality:\n\n2(2.5x + x) + 60 <= 130\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n2(3.5x) + 60 <= 130\n7x + 60 <= 130\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n7x <= 70\n\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\nx <= 10\n\nSince the width must be greater than 0, we can write the inequality as:\n\n0 < x <= 10\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice (A).\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

The growth rate is 1.9 percent, which can be written as a decimal by dividing by 100: $r = 0.019$. Now we can plug these values into the exponential growth function:\n\n$P(t) = 4(1 + 0.019)^t$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$P(t) = 4(1.019)^t$\n\nThis matches answer choice (A).

There were approximately 4 billion people in the world in 1975. Which of the following functions represents the world's population $P$, in billions of people, $t$ years since $1975 ?(1$ billion $=1,000,000,000)$ Answer Choices: (A)$P(t)=4(1.019)^{t}$ (B)$P(t)=4(1.9)^{t}$ (C)$P(t)=1.19 t+4$ (D)$P(t)=1.019 t+4$\nLet's think step by step.\nWe are given that the world's population has grown at an average rate of 1.9 percent per year since 1945. We need to find a function that represents the world's population $P$, in billions of people, $t$ years since 1975.\n\nSince the population growth is given as a percentage, we are dealing with an exponential growth function. The general form of an exponential growth function is:\n\n$P(t) = P_0(1 + r)^t$\n\nwhere $P(t)$ is the population at time $t$, $P_0$ is the initial population, $r$ is the growth rate, and $t$ is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, the initial population in 1975 is 4 billion people, so $P_0 = 4$. The growth rate is 1.9 percent, which can be written as a decimal by dividing by 100: $r = 0.019$. Now we can plug these values into the exponential growth function:\n\n$P(t) = 4(1 + 0.019)^t$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$P(t) = 4(1.019)^t$\n\nThis matches answer choice (A). So, the function that represents the world's population $P$, in billions of people, $t$ years since 1975 is:\n\n$P(t) = 4(1.019)^t$\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

In this case, $a = 3$, $b = 6$, and $c = 2$.\n\nNow, let's analyze each answer choice:\n\n(A) $y$-coordinate of the vertex: The vertex of a parabola in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by the point $(h, k)$, where $h = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ and $k = f(h)$. In this case, neither $h$ nor $k$ is directly displayed as a constant or coefficient in the equation.\n\n(B) $x$-intercept(s): The $x$-intercepts are the points where the graph intersects the $x$-axis, i.e., where $y = 0$. To find the $x$-intercepts, we would need to solve the equation $0 = 3x^2 + 6x + 2$. The $x$-intercepts are not directly displayed as constants or coefficients in the equation.\n\n(C) $y$-intercept: The $y$-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the $y$-axis, i.e., where $x = 0$. To find the $y$-intercept, we can plug in $x = 0$ into the equation: $y = 3(0)^2 + 6(0) + 2$. This simplifies to $y = 2$. The $y$-intercept is directly displayed as the constant term $c$ in the equation.\n\n(D) $x$-intercept of the line of symmetry: The line of symmetry for a parabola in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by the vertical line $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, the $x$-intercept of the line of symmetry is not directly displayed as a constant or coefficient in the equation.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is (C) $y$-intercept, which is directly displayed as the constant term $c$ in the equation.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}
