We can use the same formula, W = m * g, with the mass we found and the acceleration due to gravity for each planet.\n\n(A) Venus:\nW = 15.31 kg * 8.9 m/s²\nW ≈ 136.26 N\n\n(B) Saturn:\nW = 15.31 kg * 11.1 m/s²\nW ≈ 169.94 N\n\n(C) Uranus:\nW = 15.31 kg * 10.7 m/s²\nW ≈ 163.82 N\n\n(D) Neptune:\nW = 15.31 kg * 14.1 m/s²\nW ≈ 215.87 N\n\nAmong the answer choices, the weight of the object on Saturn (B) is closest to 170 N. However, since the question asks for an approximate weight of 170 N, the correct answer is (C) Uranus, as it is the closest option to 170 N without exceeding it.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Answer Choices: (A)16 (B)21 (C)23 (D)26\nA: Among A through D, the answer is\n(A) 16.\n\nWe can set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n1) n = 3x + 5, where x is the number of students and n is the total amount of solution.\n2) n + 21 = 4x, since Mr. Kohl needs an additional 21 milliliters to give each student 4 milliliters.\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nFrom equation 1, n = 3x + 5, so n - 5 = 3x.\nFrom equation 2, n = 4x - 21.\n\nNow, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n3x = 4x - 21 - 5\n3x = 4x - 26\nx = 26\n\nHowever, we need to check if this value of x satisfies both equations:\n\n1) n = 3x + 5 = 3(26) + 5 = 83\n2) n + 21 = 4x = 4(26) = 104\n\nSince 83 + 21 = 104, both equations are satisfied, and there are 26 students in the class. The answer is (D) 26.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

If no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, what is the value of $a$ ? Answer Choices: (A)1 (B)2 (C)4 (D)8\nA: Among A through D, the answer is\n(C) 4.\n\nTo find the value of $a$ for which no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we need to make the equation an identity. An identity is an equation that is true for all values of the variable. In this case, we want the coefficients of the $x$ terms on both sides of the equation to be equal, and the constant terms to be equal as well.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation:\n\n$$2ax - 15 = 3(x + 5) + 5(x - 1)$$\n\nDistribute the constants on the right side:\n\n$$2ax - 15 = 3x + 15 + 5x - 5$$\n\nCombine like terms on the right side:\n\n$$2ax - 15 = 8x + 10$$\n\nNow, we want the coefficients of the $x$ terms to be equal, so we set $2a$ equal to $8$:\n\n$$2a = 8$$\n\nSolve for $a$:\n\n$$a = 4$$\n\nNow, let's check if the constant terms are equal when $a = 4$:\n\n$$2(4)x - 15 = 8x + 10$$\n\n$$8x - 15 = 8x + 10$$\n\nThe $x$ terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\n$$-15 = 10$$\n\nSince this equation is not true, there is no value of $x$ that satisfies the original equation when $a = 4$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{(C) 4}$.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}
