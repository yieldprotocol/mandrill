Bryan's criticism of Beveridge's vision in Passage 1 would likely be that it is deceptive, as Bryan believes that the true goal of American governance would be economic domination and the exercise of arbitrary power.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Bryan's criticism is focused on the nature of imperialism and its effects on American government, not on the willingness of Americans to relocate to distant islands. Choice C is incorrect because Bryan does not mention the islanders' insistence on an equal distribution of resources as a reason for criticizing American governance.
