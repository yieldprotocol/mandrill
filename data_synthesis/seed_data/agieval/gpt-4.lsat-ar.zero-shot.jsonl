Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.Q: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?

(E)Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\nA: Among A through E, the answer is\n(D) Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nSince Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, the schedule looks like this:\n\nMonday: H/K/L, ?\nTuesday: H/K/L, ?\nWednesday: H/K/L, ?\n\nWe know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must take the remaining Tuesday slot:\n\nMonday: H/K/L, ?\nTuesday: H/K/L, George\nWednesday: H/K/L, ?\n\nNeither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports. However, since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore are already giving the morning reports, Olivia and Robert cannot give reports at all.\n\nNow, we know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Helen is giving a morning report, the only day she can give a report is Tuesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Monday, as it would force Helen to give a report on Tuesday, which is already occupied by George. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe schedule now looks like this:\n\nMonday: H/K/L, ?\nTuesday: Helen, George\nWednesday: H/K/L, Nina\n\nSince Irving must give a report on the day after Nina, he cannot give a report at all, as Nina is giving her report on Wednesday. This leaves Kyle and Lenore to give the remaining morning reports:\n\nMonday: H/K/L, ?\nTuesday: Helen, George\nWednesday: H/K/L, Nina\n\nSince Helen is giving a report on Tuesday, the remaining morning slots must be filled by Kyle and Lenore.

(D)At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday. (E)Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.\nA: Among A through E, the answer is", "model_input": "A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.Q: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?

(D)At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday. (E)Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.\nA: Among A through E, the answer is", "model_output": "(D) At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday. \n\nExplanation: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the three batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. From the given conditions, we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Friday. However, since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, it must be made on Friday. \n\nNow, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day. This leaves only Thursday for the second batch of peanut butter cookies. \n\nSo, we have the following schedule: \nMonday: oatmeal cookies (batch 1), sugar cookies (batch 1)\nTuesday: peanut butter cookies (batch 1), oatmeal cookies (batch 2)\nWednesday: no cookies\nThursday: sugar cookies (batch 2), peanut butter cookies (batch 2)\nFriday: peanut butter cookies (batch 3), sugar cookies (batch 3)\n\nFrom this schedule, we can see that at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, so the answer is (D).", "parse_result": "D", "label": "D", "is_correct": true, "first_stage_output": "(D) At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.", "second_stage_input": "A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.

This means that the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, because the harmonica must be auctioned before it.\n- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, so it cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, because the mirror and vase must be auctioned after it.\n- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, so it cannot be auctioned on June 6th, because the vase must be auctioned after it.\n\nUsing these deductions, we can create a schedule of possible auction dates for each antique:\n- Harmonica: June 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th\n- Lamp: June 3rd or 4th\n- Mirror: June 4th or 5th\n- Sundial: June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th\n- Table: June 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th\n- Vase: June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th\n\nNow we can check each answer choice to see if it is possible:\n(A) The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.

Since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, wall 4 must have either Greene's or Hidalgo's painting in the upper position.\n4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Since wall 4 has an oil painting in the lower position, Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 4.\n5. Therefore, Hidalgo's painting must be in the upper position of wall 4.\n6. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, Hidalgo's painting on wall 4 must be an oil painting.\n7. Now, we know that Franz's oil painting is on a wall with Greene's watercolor in the upper position. Since wall 4 has Hidalgo's oil painting in the upper position, Franz's oil painting must be on a different wall.\n8. Since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, Hidalgo's watercolor must be on a wall with another student's painting.\n9. The only option that satisfies all these conditions is that both of Franz's paintings and both of Hidalgo's paintings are displayed in upper positions.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}
