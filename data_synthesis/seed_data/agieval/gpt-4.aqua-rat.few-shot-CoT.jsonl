Then,\\n2272 - N = 875 - R\\nN - R = 875 - 2272 = -1397\\nSince N is a 3-digit number and R is the remainder, we can write N = 1397 + R.\\nNow, we need to find a 3-digit number N such that the sum of its digits is minimum.\\nThe smallest 3-digit number that can be added to 1397 to get another 3-digit number is 103 (as 100 will give a 4-digit number).\\nSo, N = 1397 + 103 = 1500\\nThe sum of the digits of N = 1 + 5 + 0 = 6\nHowever, 6 is not in the given options. Let's try the next smallest 3-digit number that can be added to 1397, which is 104.\\nN = 1397 + 104 = 1501\\nThe sum of the digits of N = 1 + 5 + 1 = 7\nAgain, 7 is not in the given options. Let's try the next smallest 3-digit number that can be added to 1397, which is 105.\\nN = 1397 + 105 = 1502\\nThe sum of the digits of N = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8\nOnce more, 8 is not in the given options. Let's try the next smallest 3-digit number that can be added to 1397, which is 106.\\nN = 1397 + 106 = 1503\\nThe sum of the digits of N = 1 + 5 + 3 = 9\nFinally, 9 is not in the given options. Let's try the next smallest 3-digit number that can be added to 1397, which is 107.\\nN = 1397 + 107 = 1504\\nThe sum of the digits of N = 1 + 5 + 4 = 10\nThe answer is therefore A", "parse_result": "A", "label": "A", "is_correct": true, "first_stage_output": "", "second_stage_input": ""}
