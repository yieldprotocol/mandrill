According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$.

According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$.

Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$.
