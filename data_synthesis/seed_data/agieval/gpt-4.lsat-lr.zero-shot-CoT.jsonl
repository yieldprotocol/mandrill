The argument then concludes that at least some of Hana's brothers must have been at the party.\n\nThe reasoning error in the argument is:\n\n(E) overlooks the possibility that a person's interest in one kind of thing is compatible with that person's interest in a different kind of thing.\n\nThis choice points out that the argument assumes that just because Hana received the recording as a gift, it must have come from her brothers. However, it is possible that someone else at the party knew about Hana's interest in the recording and decided to give it to her as a gift. The argument overlooks this possibility and jumps to the conclusion that her brothers must have been present.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.\n2. In Hallstown, most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month.\nConclusion: Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.\n\nThe flaw in this argument is that it assumes that because most people in Hallstown shop for groceries no more than three times a month, they must also buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. However, this is not necessarily true, as there could be other factors influencing their shopping habits.\n\nNow let's analyze each answer choice:\n\n(A) It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.\n\nThis argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument. It is based on the correlation between few accidents and safe driving, which is a reasonable assumption.\n\n(B) It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.\n\nThis argument also does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning. It is based on the premise that no one in John's family who does not own a car can drive, which directly leads to the conclusion that John cannot drive.\n\n(C) It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.\n\nThis argument has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument. It assumes that because all of Fernando's friends can drive and go to school, they must drive to school. However, this is not necessarily true, as there could be other factors influencing their transportation choices.\n\n(D) It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.\n\nThis argument has the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument. It assumes that because most people in Highland County commute to work and most people who commute to work drive sedans, most people in Highland County must drive sedans. However, this is not necessarily true, as there could be other factors influencing their vehicle choices.\n\n(E) It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.\n\nThis argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument. It is based on the premise that Janine only accepts rides from good drivers, which directly leads to the conclusion that most of her friends are good drivers.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer choice with the flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the original argument is (D).\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

(C)If cotton fiber replaced nylon in the production of thread and rope, there would be a resulting increase in the amount of nylon used in other manufactured products. (D)If the quantity of nylon manufactured annually decreased substantially, the volume of several pollutants that are released into the environment during its manufacture would be reduced. (E)If thread and rope continue to be made from nylon, the production of cotton fiber will not increase as rapidly as it would if all thread and rope were to be made from cotton fiber.\nLet's think step by step.\nThe argument states that using cotton fiber instead of nylon for making products like thread and rope would cause less environmental damage due to the absence of harmful gas emissions during the processing of cotton fiber. We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.\n\n(A) This statement does not directly address the comparison between nylon and cotton fiber, so it does not weaken the argument.\n\n(B) This statement actually supports the argument, as it suggests that even a partial switch to cotton fiber would reduce environmental damage.\n\n(C) This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that if cotton fiber replaced nylon in the production of thread and rope, the use of nylon in other products would increase, potentially negating the environmental benefits of using cotton fiber for thread and rope.\n\n(D) This statement also supports the argument, as it suggests that reducing nylon production would lead to a decrease in pollutants.\n\n(E) This statement does not directly address the environmental impact of using cotton fiber instead of nylon, so it does not weaken the argument.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C). If cotton fiber replaced nylon in the production of thread and rope, there would be a resulting increase in the amount of nylon used in other manufactured products.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Answer Choices: (A)failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition (B)mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result (C)treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true (D)taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true (E)describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well\nLet's think step by step.\nThe argument states that Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting \"Hero\" with a costly new advertising campaign. However, survey results show that 72 percent of consumers already believe \"Hero\" dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is considered dominant, Harrold Foods already dominates the market and only needs to maintain its current market share to continue doing so.\n\nNow, let's analyze each answer choice:\n\n(A) The argument does not discuss the cause or result of a given market condition. It only states that Harrold Foods already dominates the market according to the survey results.\n\n(B) The argument does not mistake a required condition for a sufficient condition. It simply states that having more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is the definition of dominance, and Harrold Foods meets this criterion.\n\n(C) The argument does not treat the failure to establish a claim as false as equivalent to demonstrating that the claim is true. It presents survey results as evidence for the claim that Harrold Foods dominates the market.\n\n(D) This answer choice is correct. The argument takes evidence that a claim (Harrold Foods dominating the market) is believed to be true by 72 percent of consumers as evidence that the claim is in fact true. However, just because a majority of consumers believe something does not necessarily mean it is true.\n\n(E) The argument does not describe survey results from the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future. It only states that Harrold Foods needs to maintain its current market share to continue dominating the market.\n\nTherefore, the argument commits the error in reasoning described in answer choice (D): taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

It is more concerned with the motivations behind technological advances and their impact on society.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer choices are (B) and (D). Both point out potential flaws in the argument's assumptions about the relationship between personal gain, commercial viability, and societal benefits. However, (B) is more directly related to the argument's main point, so the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Answer Choices: (A)A country's leaders realized that fostering diplomatic ties with antagonistic nations reduces the chances of war with those nations. Because those leaders worried that war would harm their chances of being reelected, they engaged in diplomatic discussions with a hostile country, and the two countries avoided a confrontation. (B)A government study concluded that a proposed bureaucratic procedure would allow people to register their cars without waiting in line. The government adopted the procedure for this reason, and, as with most bureaucratic procedures, it was not successful. (C)Betsy overheard a heating contractor say that regularly changing the filter in a furnace helps to keep the furnace efficient. So Betsy has regularly changed the furnace filter in her daughter's house. As a result, the furnace has never required maintenance due to becoming clogged with dust or dirt. (D)Sejal learned in a psychology class that the best way to help someone overcome an addiction is to confront that person. So she confronted her friend Bob, who was struggling with a chemical dependency. (E)Zachary hoped that psychotherapy could help his parents overcome their marital difficulties. He persuaded his parents to call a psychotherapist, and eventually their problems were resolved.\nLet's think step by step.\nThe proposition states that if one has evidence that an act will benefit other people and performs that act to benefit them, then one will generally succeed in benefiting them.

(B)Fractures do not develop at high-stress points, because bridges are reinforced at those points; however, stress is transferred to other points on the bridge where it causes fractures. (C)In many structures, the process of fracturing often causes high-stress points to develop. (D)Structures with no high-stress points can nonetheless have a high probability of fracturing. (E)Improper bridge construction, e.g., low-quality welding or the use of inferior steel, often leads both to the development of high-stress points and to an increased probability of fracturing.\nLet's think step by step.\nWe are looking for an answer choice that explains why bridges fracture elsewhere than at high-stress points, despite the fact that studies have shown that the more high-stress points a bridge has, the more likely it is to fracture eventually.\n\n(A) This answer choice talks about other structures, not bridges, so it doesn't help explain the phenomenon we're trying to understand.\n\n(B) This answer choice states that fractures do not develop at high-stress points because bridges are reinforced at those points. It also explains that stress is transferred to other points on the bridge where it causes fractures. This seems like a plausible explanation for why fractures develop elsewhere on the bridge.\n\n(C) This answer choice talks about the process of fracturing causing high-stress points to develop, but it doesn't explain why fractures don't develop at those high-stress points.\n\n(D) This answer choice states that structures with no high-stress points can still have a high probability of fracturing, but it doesn't explain why fractures don't develop at high-stress points on bridges.\n\n(E) This answer choice talks about improper bridge construction leading to the development of high-stress points and an increased probability of fracturing, but it doesn't explain why fractures don't develop at those high-stress points.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the answer choice that contributes most to an explanation of why bridges fracture elsewhere than at high-stress points is (B).\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

It suggests that dogs might learn from their owners' reactions, but it does not address the issue of whether discipline causes or does not cause misbehavior.\n\n(C) discipline does not cause misbehavior on the part of animals other than dogs\nThis answer choice is irrelevant to the argument, as the argument is specifically about dogs and not other animals.\n\n(D) kennel club members tend to be more skilled at raising dogs than are other dog owners\nThis answer choice is also irrelevant to the argument, as the argument is comparing kennel club members who frequently discipline their dogs to those who rarely or never do, not comparing kennel club members to other dog owners.\n\n(E) kennel club members are more likely to use discipline than are other dog owners\nThis answer choice is also irrelevant to the argument, as the argument is comparing kennel club members who frequently discipline their dogs to those who rarely or never do, not comparing kennel club members to other dog owners.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer choice is (A) dogs' misbehavior is the cause of, rather than the result of, frequent discipline. This answer choice points out the flaw in the argument by suggesting that the argument fails to consider the possibility that misbehavior might be the reason for frequent discipline, rather than discipline causing misbehavior.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

If people can adapt easily when changes are gradual, it implies that the desire for comfort or safety might be a more powerful determinant of human behavior than social inertia.\n\n(E) People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.\n- This statement supports the argument, as it provides a reason for people to embrace technological innovations.

(B)The overwhelming majority of galaxies are so far from Earth that their mass can be only roughly estimated. (C)The number of galaxies that astronomers believe exist tends to grow as the instruments used to detect galaxies become more sophisticated. (D)Theories about how galaxies are formed are rarely affected by estimates of the universe's total mass. (E)There is no consensus among astronomers on the proper procedures for estimating the universe's total mass.\nLet's think step by step.\nTo explain why the estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged despite the increase in the number of galaxies, we need to find a statement that shows the mass of these additional galaxies does not significantly impact the total mass estimation.\n\n(A) The mass of galaxies is thought to make up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass.\n\nThis statement suggests that even if the number of galaxies increases, their mass contributes only a small portion to the total mass of the universe. Therefore, the total mass estimate would not change significantly.\n\n(B) The overwhelming majority of galaxies are so far from Earth that their mass can be only roughly estimated.\n\nThis statement does not explain why the total mass estimate remains unchanged. It only explains the difficulty in estimating the mass of distant galaxies.\n\n(C) The number of galaxies that astronomers believe exist tends to grow as the instruments used to detect galaxies become more sophisticated.\n\nThis statement explains the increase in the number of galaxies but does not address the total mass estimate.\n\n(D) Theories about how galaxies are formed are rarely affected by estimates of the universe's total mass.\n\nThis statement discusses the relationship between galaxy formation theories and total mass estimates but does not explain why the total mass estimate remains unchanged.\n\n(E) There is no consensus among astronomers on the proper procedures for estimating the universe's total mass.\n\nThis statement highlights the lack of consensus on estimating the total mass but does not explain why the estimate remains unchanged despite the increase in the number of galaxies.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (A) The mass of galaxies is thought to make up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass. This statement explains why the total mass estimate remains virtually unchanged even with the discovery of 40 billion more galaxies.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Scientists are almost never asked to solve problems that are not subject to such formulation.Q: The science writer's statements, if true, most strongly support which one of the following? Answer Choices: (A)If a problem can be formulated in such a way as to make a scientific solution feasible, scientists will usually be called upon to solve that problem. (B)Any problem a scientist can solve can be formulated in such a way as to make a scientific solution feasible. (C)Scientists would probably have a lower success rate with research problems if their grounds for selecting such problems were less narrow. (D)Most of the problems scientists are called upon to solve are problems that politicians and business leaders want solved, but whose formulation the scientists have helped to guide. (E)The only reason for the astounding success rate of science is that the problems scientists are called upon to solve are usually selected by the scientists themselves.\nLet's think step by step.\nThe science writer's statements mention:\n\n1.

The conclusion is that consumers who do not bother to acquire such information are behaving rationally.\n\nNow let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) Rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase usually do not bother to acquire such information.\n\nThis answer choice supports the conclusion by stating that rational consumers usually do not bother to acquire detailed information if they do not expect the benefits to outweigh the costs. This assumption helps to establish the connection between not acquiring information and rational behavior.\n\n(B) Whenever it is rational not to acquire detailed information about a product, it would be irrational to bother to acquire such information.\n\nThis answer choice is too strong and does not necessarily support the conclusion. It states that it would always be irrational to acquire information when it is rational not to, but the argument is about consumers who do not bother to acquire information, not those who do.\n\n(C) The benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product one might purchase usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n\nThis answer choice provides a general statement about the benefits and costs of acquiring detailed information, but it does not directly support the conclusion that consumers who do not bother to acquire such information are behaving rationally.\n\n(D) Rational consumers usually expect that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase would not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n\nThis answer choice is similar to (A), but it focuses on the expectations of rational consumers rather than their actions. It does not directly support the conclusion that not acquiring information is rational behavior.\n\n(E) Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n\nThis answer choice explains the mindset of consumers who do not bother to acquire information but does not directly support the conclusion that their behavior is rational.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer choice is (A), as it directly supports the conclusion by connecting rational behavior with not acquiring detailed information when the benefits do not outweigh the costs.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

(E)There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.\nLet's think step by step.\nThe argument states that it is misguided to consider H. pylori a commensal because only a small percentage of people with the bacteria develop stomach ulcers, and it allegedly strengthens immune response. The argument then compares this to M. tuberculosis, which also affects a small percentage of people who harbor it, but is not considered a commensal.\n\nTo undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows a significant difference between H. pylori and M. tuberculosis that would justify considering H. pylori a commensal while not considering M. tuberculosis one.\n\n(A) Both can be treated with antibiotics - This does not provide a significant difference between the two bacteria that would justify considering one a commensal and not the other.\n\n(B) Tuberculosis lasts longer than ulcers - This does not provide a significant difference between the two bacteria that would justify considering one a commensal and not the other.\n\n(C) People who harbor M. tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence - This statement shows a significant difference between the two bacteria. If H. pylori strengthens immune response (provides a benefit), while M. tuberculosis provides no benefit, this could justify considering H. pylori a commensal and not M. tuberculosis.\n\n(D) More people harbor M. tuberculosis than H. pylori - The number of people harboring each bacteria does not provide a significant difference that would justify considering one a commensal and not the other.\n\n(E) More people harbor H. pylori than M. tuberculosis - The number of people harboring each bacteria does not provide a significant difference that would justify considering one a commensal and not the other.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (C) People who harbor M. tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence. This statement most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning by providing a significant difference between the two bacteria that could justify considering H. pylori a commensal and not M. tuberculosis.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

However, if \"production cost\" refers to the cost of producing the product in the country where it is sold, then Country F's producers are indeed dumping shrimp in Country G.\n\n(B) There is agreement among experts about whether dumping is harmful to the economy of the country in which products are sold for less than production cost.\n\nThis answer choice is not necessary to evaluate the argument. The argument is about whether Country F's producers are dumping shrimp, not about the potential harm of dumping.\n\n(C) Shrimp producers from Country F charge more for shrimp that they sell within their own country than for shrimp that they sell in Country G.\n\nThis answer choice is not necessary to evaluate the argument. The argument is about whether Country F's producers are dumping shrimp in Country G, not about the price difference between the two countries.\n\n(D) Shrimp producers from Country F will eventually go out of business if they continue to sell shrimp in Country G for less than production cost.\n\nThis answer choice is not necessary to evaluate the argument. The argument is about whether Country F's producers are dumping shrimp in Country G, not about the potential consequences for the producers.\n\n(E) Shrimp producers from Country F are selling shrimp in Country G for considerably less than production cost or just slightly less.\n\nThis answer choice is not necessary to evaluate the argument. The argument is about whether Country F's producers are dumping shrimp in Country G, not about the extent of the price difference.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) \"production cost\" in the definition of dumping refers to the cost of producing the product in the country where it originates or in the country where it is sold.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

The ethicist disagrees with Tolstoy and believes that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean we cannot see the action as freely performed.\n\nNow, let's analyze each answer choice to see which one, if assumed, would enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn:\n\n(A) People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.\n- This statement does not directly address the issue of whether knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action affects our perception of the action as freely performed.\n\n(B) Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.\n- This statement also does not directly address the issue of whether knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action affects our perception of the action as freely performed.\n\n(C) We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.\n- This statement directly addresses the issue at hand. If we assume this statement to be true, it supports the ethicist's argument that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean we cannot see the action as freely performed. This is because, according to this statement, we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we see it as freely performed.\n\n(D) The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.\n- This statement does not directly address the issue of whether knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action affects our perception of the action as freely performed.\n\n(E) If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.\n- This statement is the opposite of Tolstoy's claim, but it does not directly address the issue of whether knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action affects our perception of the action as freely performed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is (C). If we assume that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed, it enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

There is good reason to regard their hypothesis as false, however, for they merely offer empirical arguments against the view that life evolved on Earth; neither they nor anyone else has provided positive support for the extraterrestrial-spore theory of the origin of terrestrial life.Q: The reasoning in the astronomer's argument is flawed because the argument Answer Choices: (A)concludes, simply because there is no evidence in favor of a hypothesis, that there is evidence against that hypothesis (B)fails to justify its claim that the view being criticized is inherently implausible (C)reasons that a hypothesis is false simply because there is another hypothesis that is equally likely to be true (D)attempts to derive a conclusion from premises that contradict it (E)grants the truth of claims that are made by the advocates of the hypothesis but that do nothing to\nLet's think step by step.\nThe astronomer's argument states that the extraterrestrial-spore theory is false because it only provides empirical arguments against life evolving on Earth, without providing positive support for the extraterrestrial-spore theory itself. \n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) The argument does not conclude that there is evidence against the hypothesis simply because there is no evidence in favor of it. Instead, it points out the lack of positive support for the hypothesis. So, this choice is incorrect.\n\n(B) The argument does not focus on the inherent implausibility of the view being criticized. It focuses on the lack of positive support for the extraterrestrial-spore theory. So, this choice is incorrect.\n\n(C) The argument does not claim that there is another hypothesis equally likely to be true. It only criticizes the lack of positive support for the extraterrestrial-spore theory. So, this choice is incorrect.\n\n(D) The premises of the argument do not contradict the conclusion. The premises state that the extraterrestrial-spore theory lacks positive support, and the conclusion is that there is good reason to regard the hypothesis as false. So, this choice is incorrect.\n\n(E) The astronomer's argument does grant the truth of claims made by the proponents of the extraterrestrial-spore theory (e.g., the meteorite bombardments and the time frame for life to evolve on Earth). However, the argument points out that these claims do not provide positive support for the extraterrestrial-spore theory itself. So, this choice is correct.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Answer Choices: (A)A leading science journal has concluded that data provided by the manufacturer of a certain controversial new medication are accurate. The journal is generally reliable on such matters. Thus, the medication is probably safe, for if the company's data are accurate, the medication must be safe. (B)The data from the manufacturer of a controversial new medication prove that the medication is safe, because a leading science journal has concluded that the medication is safe, and it would not have done so had the manufacturer's data not proven that the medication is safe. (C)A leading science journal states that a certain controversial new medication is safe if the data provided by the company that developed the drug are accurate. Thus, the medication is probably safe, for the science journal is rarely wrong about such matters, and the company's data are accurate. (D)A leading science journal states that the data provided by the manufacturer of a controversial new medication are probably accurate and that if they are accurate, the medication is safe. Thus, the manufacturer's data are probably accurate, for the science journal is fairly reliable on such matters.

The argument also assumes that uncertainty is more stressful than knowing one's future.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) Stress sometimes reduces the amount of pain a heart patient experiences.\nThis choice seems to be a logical conclusion since the argument states that patients who were uncertain (and presumably more stressed) experienced less pain.\n\n(B) The pain experienced by heart patients is to some extent beneficial.\nThis choice does not logically follow the argument, as it does not address the relationship between stress and pain.\n\n(C) The severity of a heart patient's condition is usually worsened by withholding information from the patient about the treatment that that patient will receive.\nThis choice contradicts the argument, which states that patients who were uncertain experienced less pain.\n\n(D) Stress is probably an effect rather than a cause of reduced blood flow to the heart.\nThis choice does not logically follow the argument, as it does not address the relationship between stress and pain.\n\n(E) Heart patients suffering from reduced blood flow to the heart who are experiencing pain from the condition are more likely to require surgery than are such patients who are not experiencing pain.\nThis choice does not logically follow the argument, as it does not address the relationship between stress and pain.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical answer to complete the argument is:\n\n(A) Stress sometimes reduces the amount of pain a heart patient experiences.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

People from other nations are equal in worth to the people of the prime minister's nation.\n\nThe apparent conflict is that if people from other nations are equal in worth, why should the government prioritize the needs of its own people?\n\nNow let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) This principle suggests that a government should only prioritize a group's needs if they are objectively more important than any other group's needs. This does not help reconcile the conflict, as it does not explain why a government should prioritize its own people's needs when they are equal in worth to others.\n\n(B) This principle states that a government should prioritize its own people's needs only if they are more worthy than other nations' people. This contradicts the prime minister's claim that people from other nations are equal in worth.\n\n(C) This principle suggests that the priority a government places on satisfying needs depends on the objective importance of those needs. This does not help reconcile the conflict, as it does not address the issue of prioritizing one's own people when they are equal in worth to others.\n\n(D) This principle states that when people from two nations are equally worthy, their needs should be satisfied primarily by their own governments. This principle helps reconcile the conflict, as it explains why a government should prioritize its own people's needs even when they are equal in worth to others.\n\n(E) This principle suggests that a government should prioritize a group's needs only if there is no other way for those needs to be satisfied. This does not help reconcile the conflict, as it does not address the issue of prioritizing one's own people when they are equal in worth to others.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (D). When people of two nations are equally worthy, the needs of the people of each of those nations should be satisfied primarily by the people's own governments. This principle helps reconcile the apparent conflict among the prime minister's claims.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

It uses the fact that the species are not closely related to conclude that the specialization evolved more than once.\n\n(D) infers merely because something was likely to occur that it did occur\n- The argument does not infer that something happened just because it was likely.

The argument is about the improved recall the next day, not the initial learning process.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (B). Neither the mice who received the ginkgo nor the other mice in the experiment exhibited physiological signs of higher-than-normal stress. This weakens the argument that ginkgo improved recall by reducing stress.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

(B)Once the images printed on a banknote have been measured accurately, there is no further impediment to the banknote's being exactly replicated. (C)Governments have better printing technology available to them than counterfeiters do. (D)Few countries produce banknotes with images that are difficult for counterfeiters to measure accurately. (E)New designs in banknotes generally lead to decreases in the amount of counterfeit currency in circulation.\nLet's think step by step.\nThe argument states that to prevent the production of high-quality counterfeit banknotes, some of the images on banknotes must be made very difficult or impossible to measure accurately. We need to find an assumption that supports this conclusion.\n\n(A) Today's copying technology is sophisticated enough to replicate almost any paper product with great precision.\n- This statement highlights the capabilities of copying technology but does not directly support the conclusion that making images difficult to measure will prevent counterfeiting.\n\n(B) Once the images printed on a banknote have been measured accurately, there is no further impediment to the banknote's being exactly replicated.\n- This statement supports the conclusion by implying that accurate measurements are a crucial step in counterfeiting. If this step is made difficult or impossible, it would prevent the production of high-quality counterfeit banknotes.\n\n(C) Governments have better printing technology available to them than counterfeiters do.\n- While this statement may be true, it does not directly support the conclusion that making images difficult to measure will prevent counterfeiting.\n\n(D) Few countries produce banknotes with images that are difficult for counterfeiters to measure accurately.\n- This statement provides information about the current state of banknote production but does not directly support the conclusion that making images difficult to measure will prevent counterfeiting.\n\n(E) New designs in banknotes generally lead to decreases in the amount of counterfeit currency in circulation.\n- This statement suggests that new designs can help reduce counterfeiting, but it does not specifically address the importance of making images difficult to measure.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer choice is (B). The argument's conclusion can be properly drawn if it is assumed that once the images printed on a banknote have been measured accurately, there is no further impediment to the banknote's being exactly replicated.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

(E)To obtain a dramatic improvement in one's cardiovascular health, one must exercise strenuously at least occasionally.\nLet's think step by step.\nThe statements above mention that modest amounts of exercise can improve cardiovascular health, and that exercising most days of the week with the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking can provide benefits. It also mentions that more vigorous exercise is more effective, but not absolutely necessary.\n\nNow let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) The statements do not specifically mention that having a strenuous workout most days of the week can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. They only say that more vigorous exercise is more effective, but not absolutely necessary.\n\n(B) The statements do not mention anything about doing an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week.\n\n(C) This answer choice is supported by the statements, as they mention that half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week can provide cardiovascular health benefits, and that more vigorous exercise is more effective but not absolutely necessary. This implies that it is possible to obtain similar improvements in cardiovascular health from both types of exercise.\n\n(D) The statements do not discuss any other methods of improving cardiovascular health aside from exercise.\n\n(E) The statements mention that more vigorous exercise is more effective but not absolutely necessary, which implies that one does not need to exercise strenuously to obtain a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer choice most strongly supported by the statements above is (C) It is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

This is not necessarily true, as the absence of one combination (cosmetics and toothpaste) does not guarantee the presence of the other combination (cosmetics and shampoo).\n\n(D) Virtually every pharmacy that sells shampoo also sells toothpaste. Most pharmacies sell cosmetics. Therefore, there must be some pharmacies that sell both cosmetics and toothpaste and some that sell both cosmetics and shampoo.\n\nThis choice does not have a flawed reasoning pattern. It simply states that since most pharmacies sell cosmetics and virtually every pharmacy that sells shampoo also sells toothpaste, there must be some pharmacies that sell both cosmetics and toothpaste and some that sell both cosmetics and shampoo.\n\n(E) Nearly all pharmacies sell either shampoo or toothpaste, or both. Therefore, since most pharmacies sell cosmetics, there must be some pharmacies that sell both cosmetics and toothpaste and some that sell both cosmetics and shampoo.\n\nThis choice does not have a flawed reasoning pattern.

Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.Q: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument Answer Choices: (A)mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product (B)does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them (C)fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers (D)overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years (E)provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products\nLet's think step by step.\nThe argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer market share has dropped from 50% to 25% over the past 5 years, and the average net income per hair dryer sold has remained the same. Based on this information, the argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.\n\nNow let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product\n\nThis answer choice points out a flaw in the argument's reasoning. The argument assumes that a decline in market share automatically means a decline in total sales, which is not necessarily true. If the overall market for hair dryers has grown, it is possible that Wilson Appliance's total sales have remained the same or even increased, despite the decline in market share. Therefore, this answer choice is correct.\n\n(B) does not provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them\n\nThis answer choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument is focused on Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of its hair dryer, not the profits generated by other companies that produce hair dryers. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\n(C) fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers\n\nThis answer choice is also not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument is specifically about the net income from sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer, not its other products. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\n(D) overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years\n\nThis answer choice is not relevant because the argument states that the average net income per hair dryer sold has remained the same over the past 5 years. This implies that any changes in the retail price would not affect the net income per hair dryer sold. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\n(E) provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products\n\nThis answer choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument is focused on the net income from sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer, not whether it is one of the company's least profitable products. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (A) because it points out the flaw in the argument's reasoning by highlighting the mistake of assuming a decline in market share automatically means a decline in total sales.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

This helps resolve the discrepancy.\n\n(D) Small abalone species reproducing more rapidly than larger ones does not explain why large abalones would develop in the presence of their predators.\n\n(E) Otters preferring large abalones over small ones does not resolve the discrepancy, as it would make it even more difficult for large abalones to develop in the presence of otters.\n\nTherefore, the answer choice that most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above is (C) Otters also prey on the abalones' competitors for food and so indirectly make it easier for abalones to get food.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}
