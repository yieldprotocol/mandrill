If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.Q: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively? Answer Choices: (A)Irving, Lenore, and Nina (B)Lenore, George, and Irving (C)Nina, Irving, and Lenore (D)Robert, George, and Irving (E)Robert, Irving, and Lenore\nLet's think step by step.\nSince Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, we know the following:\n\n1. George must give the morning report on Tuesday since it's the only day he can give a report.\n2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports if they give a report at all.\n\nNow let's analyze each answer choice:\n\n(A) Irving, Lenore, and Nina\n- Monday: Irving (morning), unknown (afternoon)\n- Tuesday: George (morning), Kyle (afternoon)\n- Wednesday: Nina (morning), Helen (afternoon)\nSince Nina gives a report on Wednesday, there is no need for Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day. This choice is possible.\n\n(B) Lenore, George, and Irving\n- Monday: Lenore (morning), unknown (afternoon)\n- Tuesday: George (morning), Kyle (afternoon)\n- Wednesday: Irving (morning), Helen (afternoon)\nThis choice violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday.\n\n(C) Nina, Irving, and Lenore\n- Monday: Nina (morning), unknown (afternoon)\n- Tuesday: Irving (morning), Kyle (afternoon)\n- Wednesday: Lenore (morning), Helen (afternoon)\nSince Nina gives a report on Monday, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. However, Irving is giving a report on Tuesday, but Helen is giving a report on Wednesday. This choice is not possible.\n\n(D) Robert, George, and Irving\n- Monday: Robert (morning), unknown (afternoon)\n- Tuesday: George (morning), Kyle (afternoon)\n- Wednesday: Irving (morning), Helen (afternoon)\nThis choice does not violate any conditions, but it does not account for the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Nina is not giving a report in this choice, it is not possible.\n\n(E) Robert, Irving, and Lenore\n- Monday: Robert (morning), unknown (afternoon)\n- Tuesday: Irving (morning), Kyle (afternoon)\n- Wednesday: Lenore (morning), Helen (afternoon)\nThis choice violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (A) Irving, Lenore, and Nina.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Since F is sixth, there must be at least two compositions after R and before F. This means R must be performed third or earlier.\n\n3. O is performed either first or fifth. Since T is fifth, O must be performed first.\n\n4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. This means the last spot is either L or H.\n\n5. P is performed at some time before S. We don't have enough information to place P and S yet.\n\n6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is first, there must be at least one composition between O and S.\n\nNow our composition order looks like this:\n\nO _ R _ T F _ _\n\nSince R must be performed third or earlier, and O is first, R must be performed second. Now we have:\n\nO R _ _ T F _ _\n\nWe know that P must be performed before S, and there must be at least one composition between O and S. The only available spots for P and S are third, fourth, and seventh. If P is third, then S must be seventh. If S is third, then P must be fourth.

This statement is not necessarily true, as G could be selected along with K.\n\n(B) If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\nThere is no direct restriction between L and F in the conditions, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n(C) If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\nSince M cannot be selected, the only other option for a single chemist is L. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\n(D) If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\nIf two chemists are selected, they must be K and L, since M cannot be selected. In this case, F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. This statement is true.\n\n(E) If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\nIf two chemists are selected (K and L), there is no direct restriction on G being selected. This statement is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.Q: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true? Answer Choices: (A)Togowa is assigned parking space #1. (B)Young is assigned parking space #2. (C)Robertson is assigned parking space #3. (D)Souza is assigned parking space #3. (E)Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nLet's think step by step.\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nNow, we are given that Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n\nLet's analyze each answer choice:\n\n(A) Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\nIf Togowa is assigned #1, then Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space, so Young could be assigned #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. Since Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, this choice is possible.\n\n(B) Young is assigned parking space #2.\nIf Young is assigned #2, then Robertson must be assigned #1 (since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young). However, this would mean that Togowa cannot have a lower-numbered parking space than Young, which contradicts rule 1. So, this choice is not possible.\n\n(C) Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\nIf Robertson is assigned #3, then Young must be assigned #4, #5, or #6. However, this would mean that Togowa cannot have a lower-numbered parking space than Young, which contradicts rule 1. So, this choice is not possible.\n\n(D) Souza is assigned parking space #3.\nIf Souza is assigned #3, then Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space, so Xu could be assigned #4, #5, or #6. However, this would mean that Young cannot be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which contradicts the given condition. So, this choice is not possible.\n\n(E) Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nThis choice does not provide enough information to determine if it contradicts any of the rules or the given condition. Therefore, it could be true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\nSince the third solo is a traditional piece and exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively, the fourth solo must also be a traditional piece. \n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for the fourth solo:\n- If Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo, then condition 3 is satisfied.\n- If Zara performs a modern piece in the fourth solo, it contradicts the fact that the fourth solo must be a traditional piece.\n\nSo, Wayne must perform a traditional piece in the fourth solo.\n\nNow, let's consider the fifth solo:\n- Since the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo, and Wayne performs the fourth solo, Zara must perform the fifth solo.\n\nFinally, let's consider the first and second solos:\n- No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. Since Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo, he must perform a modern piece before that. The only available solo for Wayne to perform a modern piece is the second solo.\n- Therefore, Zara must perform the first solo, which must be a modern piece since no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs a modern piece.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is 1 (the fourth solo). So, the correct answer is (B) one.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) J, K: Since J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning, K can be shown in the afternoon, and J can be shown right after K in the evening. So, J and K can be shown consecutively.\n\n(B) J, M: Since J must be shown in the evening and L must be shown before M, it is possible for L to be shown in the afternoon and M to be shown right after J in the evening. So, J and M can be shown consecutively.\n\n(C) J, O: There are no constraints on when O can be shown. Since J must be shown in the evening, O can also be shown in the evening, either before or after J. So, J and O can be shown consecutively.\n\n(D) J, P: There are no constraints on when P can be shown. Since J must be shown in the evening, P can also be shown in the evening, either before or after J. So, J and P can be shown consecutively.\n\n(E) M, P: There are no constraints on when P can be shown. However, since L must be shown before M, M cannot be the first house shown in the afternoon. Therefore, M and P cannot be shown consecutively in either order, as P would have to be shown in the afternoon for them to be consecutive, which is not possible due to the constraint on M.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (E) M, P.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Answer Choices: (A)The western begins at 7 P.M. (B)The sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M. (C)The mystery begins at 8 P.M. (D)The romance begins at 9 P.M. (E)The horror film begins at 8 P.M.\nLet's think step by step.\n1. The western begins before the horror film.\n2. The sci-fi film is not on screen 3.\n3. The romance is not on screen 2.\n4. The horror film and the mystery are on different screens.\n5. The sci-fi film and the romance are on the same screen.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for each screen:\n\nScreen 1:\n- If the sci-fi film and the romance are shown on screen 1, they must be at 7 P.M. and 9 P.M. (order unknown).\n- The horror film cannot be on screen 1, as the western must be before the horror film, and there's no time slot left on screen 1.\n- The mystery can be on screen 1, but then the horror film must be on screen 3.\n\nScreen 2:\n- The romance cannot be on screen 2.\n- The sci-fi film can be on screen 2, but then the romance must be on screen 1.\n\nScreen 3:\n- The sci-fi film cannot be on screen 3.\n- If the horror film is on screen 3, then the western must be at 7 P.M. on either screen 1 or screen 2.\n- The mystery can be on screen 3.\n\nNow let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) The western begins at 7 P.M.\n- This is possible but not necessary, as the western could also be at 9 P.M. on screen 2 if the horror film is on screen 3.\n\n(B) The sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M.\n- This is possible but not necessary, as the sci-fi film could also be at 7 P.M. on screen 1.\n\n(C) The mystery begins at 8 P.M.\n- If the mystery is at 8 P.M. on screen 3, then the horror film must be on screen 1 or 2, and the western must be before the horror film. This is a valid possibility and must be true if the sci-fi film and the romance are on the same screen.\n\n(D) The romance begins at 9 P.M.\n- This is possible but not necessary, as the romance could also be at 7 P.M. on screen 1.\n\n(E) The horror film begins at 8 P.M.\n- This is possible but not necessary, as the horror film could also be at 9 P.M. on screen 1 if the mystery is on screen 3.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (C) The mystery begins at 8 P.M.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.

Answer Choices: (A)Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. (B)Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. (C)Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. (D)Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. (E)Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.\nLet's think step by step.\n1. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, wall 4 must have another student's painting in the upper position. It cannot be Franz's painting because no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. So, the upper position of wall 4 must have either Greene's or Hidalgo's painting.\n\n2. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Since Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, this means that Greene's paintings are on different walls. Therefore, the upper position of wall 4 must have Hidalgo's painting.\n\n3. Now we know that wall 4 has Hidalgo's painting in the upper position and Isaacs's oil in the lower position. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, Hidalgo's painting on wall 4 must be an oil painting.\n\n4. Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, this means that Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor are on a different wall than Greene's watercolor and Franz's oil.\n\n5.
