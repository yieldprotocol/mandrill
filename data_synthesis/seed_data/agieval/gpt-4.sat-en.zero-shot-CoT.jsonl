{"index": 5, "problem_input": "The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid (DN(A)is now well established. The molecule is a very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a  regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which can be of four different types. Two of the possible bases-adenine and guanine - are purines, and the other two-thymine and cytosine-are pyrimidines. So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the 10 chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of phosphate, sugar and base, is known as a nucleotide.The first feature of our structure which is of biological interest is that it consists not of one chain, but of two. These two chains are both coiled around15 a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that since there was only one chain in the chemical formula there would only be one in the structural unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.The other biologically important feature is the manner in which the two chains are held together. This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases. The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single25 base from the other. The important point is that only certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.One member of a pair must be a purine and the other a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for 30 example, there would not be room for it.We believe that the bases will be present almost entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true, the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are: 35 adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine. Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but when it does, its partner on the other chain must always be thymine.The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is 40 completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of bases can fit into the structure.

They also hope25 to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth, in which the materials extracted and processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered for space-based projects.In this scenario, water mined from other 30 worlds could become the most desired commodity. \"In the desert, what's worth more: a kilogram of gold or a kilogram of water?\" asks Kris Zacny of HoneyBee Robotics in New York. \"Gold is useless. Water will let you live.\"35 Water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary 40 refuelling stations. Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into 45 concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.\\section{Passage 2}The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting from discovery to economics. The past year has seen a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few0 billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all.But before the miners start firing up their rockets, we should pause for thought. At first glance, space55 mining seems to sidestep most environmental concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids, and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences -both here on Earth and in space -merit careful consideration.60 Part of this is about principles. Some will argue that space's \"magnificent desolation\" is not ours to despoil, just as they argue that our own planet's poles should remain pristine. Others will suggest that glutting ourselves on space's riches is not an65 acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable ways of earthly life.History suggests that those will be hard lines to hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public that such barren environments are worth preserving.70 After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even fewer people will experience them than have walked through Antarctica's icy landscapes.There's also the emerging off-world economy to consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and 75 beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely been broached-and the relevant legal and regulatory framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are 80 often reluctant to engage with such questions.One speaker at last week's space-mining forum in Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that regulation should be avoided. But miners have much to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit 85 exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek one outQ: Which point about the resources that will be highly valued in space is implicit in Passage 1 and explicit in Passage 2 ? Answer Choices: (A)They may be different resources from those that are valuable on Earth. (B)They will be valuable only if they can be harvested cheaply. (C)They are likely to be primarily precious metals and rare earth elements.\nLet's think step by step.\nPassage 1 discusses the potential value of water in space, stating that \"water mined from other worlds could become the most desired commodity.\" It also mentions the potential value of iron, silicon, and aluminum for use in 3D printers and construction in space. However, it does not explicitly compare these resources to those valuable on Earth.\n\nPassage 2 explicitly states that \"the resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different from those we prize on Earth.\" This point is directly addressing the difference in value between resources in space and those on Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) They may be different resources from those that are valuable on Earth.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa.

She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a \"fruitful intermission\" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day.

That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes.

Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 \"And can you guess what we saw from the train?\" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. \"Camels!\" she said. \"We saw a whole caravan of camels.\" She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up.\"She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem,\" Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then.

(B)small rural town. (C)town that is home to a prominent university. (D)comfortable suburb.\nLet's think step by step.\nThe passage describes Threestep as a place where the new schoolteacher, Miss Spivey, arrives to bring \"democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.\" It also mentions that there are twenty-six students across seven grade levels in one room, which suggests a small community.

When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 \"And can you guess what we saw from the train?\" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. \"Camels!\" she said. \"We saw a whole caravan of camels.\" She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up.\"She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem,\" Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, \"That's right.\"1 The Works Progress Administration (WP(A)was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.Q: The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord serves mainly to Answer Choices: (A)suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge. (B)establish a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor. (C)introduce Ralphord as a precocious young student and Miss Spivey as a dismissive and disinterested teacher. (D)demonstrate that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions.\nLet's think step by step.\n(A) suggests that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge. This could be true, as she expects the students to have heard of Columbia University and seems to assume they would know about Barnard College.\n\n(B) establishes a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor. This is not entirely accurate, as Miss Spivey avoids Ralphord's eye and does not seem to be indulgent or doting.\n\n(C) introduces Ralphord as a precocious young student and Miss Spivey as a dismissive and disinterested teacher. Ralphord does ask a question, but it is not clear that he is precocious. Miss Spivey does not seem dismissive or disinterested, but she does avoid Ralphord's eye.\n\n(D) demonstrates that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions. This is not evident from the interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer choice is (A) - suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, \"We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been,\" and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a \"fruitful intermission\" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 \"And can you guess what we saw from the train?\" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. \"Camels!\" she said. \"We saw a whole caravan of camels.\" She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up.\"She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem,\" Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, \"That's right.\"1 The Works Progress Administration (WP(A)was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.Q: In the passage, when Miss Spivey announces that she had seen camels, the students' reaction suggests that they are Answer Choices: (A)delighted. (B)fascinated. (C)baffled. (D)worried.\nLet's think step by step.\nFirst, let's look at the part of the passage where Miss Spivey talks about the camels:\n\n\"And can you guess what we saw from the train?\" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. \"Camels!\" she said. \"We saw a whole caravan of camels.\" She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.\n\nFrom this part, we can see that Miss Spivey expected the students to be amazed and delighted. However, the passage continues:\n\nWe all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up.\"She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem,\" Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the room.\n\nThis part shows that the students were not immediately amazed or delighted. Instead, they were thinking hard, trying to understand the significance of the camels. This suggests that the students were baffled by Miss Spivey's announcement.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) baffled.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}
{"index": 23, "problem_input": "In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these \"low-threshold\" nerves \"C-tactile,\" or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their \"exquisite sensitivity\" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \\mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensationsQ: Based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected which condition to result from the blocking of fast fibers?

But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensationsQ: Which conclusion is best supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment? Answer Choices: (A)Stimulation at bodily extremities can be sensed as rapidly as stimulation closer to the brain. (B)The presence of hairs in human skin lessens the speed with which nerves conduct signals. (C)Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers. (D)The speed at which a nerve fires is dependent on the strength of pressure applied to the nerve.\nLet's think step by step.\n\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}
{"index": 25, "problem_input": "In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these \"low-threshold\" nerves \"C-tactile,\" or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their \"exquisite sensitivity\" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \\mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather.

Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \\mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensationsQ: According to the passage, humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when Answer Choices: (A)brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals. (B)CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus. (C)nerve fibers that sense pain are suppressed. (D)conscious aspects of sensation are ignored.\nA: Among A through D, the answer is", "model_input": "In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these \"low-threshold\" nerves \"C-tactile,\" or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their \"exquisite sensitivity\" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying.

{"index": 33, "problem_input": "Many millennia before the invention of herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a  valuable part of an integrated weed-management 5 program. Although plowing kills standing weeds, farmers have long known that it often leads to the emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.Ecologists have shown that a farmer's field can have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter 10 buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists have shown that seeds buried more than about one centimeter below the soil surface do not receive enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow, which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil15 surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a 20 relatively simple experiment, they went to ten different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then25 exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples, weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a \"light break,\" and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany. Because many of the same weed species that invade farmers' fields70 in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world, this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact, recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon, Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina support this idea.

Do the blades of a plow, which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil15 surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a 20 relatively simple experiment, they went to ten different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then25 exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples, weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a \"light break,\" and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany.

Even today, plowing can constitute a  valuable part of an integrated weed-management 5 program. Although plowing kills standing weeds, farmers have long known that it often leads to the emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.Ecologists have shown that a farmer's field can have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter 10 buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists have shown that seeds buried more than about one centimeter below the soil surface do not receive enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow, which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil15 surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a 20 relatively simple experiment, they went to ten different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then25 exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples, weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a \"light break,\" and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany.

Answer Choices: (A)A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job. (B)A woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else. (C)A woman impersonates someone else to seek revenge on an acquaintance. (D)A woman takes an immediate dislike to her new employer.\nLet's think step by step.\n(A) A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job. - This is not accurate, as Lady Carlotta does not weigh the pros and cons of the situation; she simply goes along with the mistaken identity.\n\n(B) A woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else. - This is accurate, as Lady Carlotta is mistaken for a governess and does not correct Mrs. Quabarl.\n\n(C) A woman impersonates someone else to seek revenge on an acquaintance. - This is not accurate, as there is no mention of revenge in the passage.\n\n(D) A woman takes an immediate dislike to her new employer. - This is not entirely accurate, as Lady Carlotta does not necessarily take an immediate dislike to Mrs. Quabarl, but rather asserts her own opinions and preferences.\n\nThe best summary of the passage is (B) A woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

{"index": 42, "problem_input": "At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. \"They jumped up like popcorn,\" he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. \"He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!\" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. \"I asked 35 him how it went,\" Ken recalled, \"and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' \" Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the \"aha\" moment. \"The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively,\" he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. \"It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car,\" he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)Q: Which choice best reflects the overall sequence of events in the passage? Answer Choices: (A)An experiment is proposed but proves unworkable; a less ambitious experiment is attempted, and it yields data that give rise to a new set of questions.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Women are not naturally suited for the exercise of civil and political rights.", "second_stage_input": "\\section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, \"that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain.\" If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?Q: How would the authors of Passage 1 most likely respond to the points made in the final paragraph of Passage 2? Answer Choices: (A)Women are not naturally suited for the exercise of civil and political rights. (B)Men and women possess similar degrees of reasoning ability. (C)Women do not need to remain confined to their traditional family duties. (D)The principles of natural law should not be invoked when considering gender roles.\nLet's think step by step.\nThe final paragraph of Passage 2 argues against the subjugation of women and questions the authority of men as the exclusive judge of women's happiness. It also criticizes the denial of civil and political rights to women, which keeps them confined to their families and in the dark.\n\nNow, let's consider the authors of Passage 1 and their views. They believe that women's happiness and interests lie in their traditional roles, and that their delicate constitutions and duties of motherhood make them unsuitable for political rights and functions.\n\nGiven this context, the authors of Passage 1 would most likely respond to the points made in the final paragraph of Passage 2 by asserting that women are not naturally suited for the exercise of civil and political rights.

These mites feed on bee hemolymph (bloo(D)and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them.

It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four  down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other15 page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed 20 on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of25 Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and 30 determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and 35 began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thum(B)presided over the Congress, and40 Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France.A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie.45 The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against 50 the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp 55 cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. 60 Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress65 were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68 , but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, \"I didn't think you 70 were coming.\"Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his75 scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.80 Apparently he himself was not aware that there had been any change. He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth85 finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of 90 the moon. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.Q: The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters Answer Choices: (A)neglects to spend any time with his family members.

Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the \"physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature.\" To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.Q: In Passage 1, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely Answer Choices: (A)overlooked, because few men are interested in women's thoughts about politics. (B)indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life. (C)unnecessary, because men are able to govern society themselves. (D)symbolic, because women tend to be more idealistic about politics than men are.\nLet's think step by step.\nIn Passage 1, Beecher discusses the role of women in society and how they can exert their influence. The passage states, \"But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling and action; that her motives will be reverenced... then, the fathers, the husbands, and the sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly.\"\n\nFrom this, we can understand that Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely:\n\n(A) overlooked, because few men are interested in women's thoughts about politics. - This is not mentioned in the passage.\n(B) indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life. - This matches the passage's description of women's influence.\n(C) unnecessary, because men are able to govern society themselves. - This is not mentioned in the passage.\n(D) symbolic, because women tend to be more idealistic about politics than men are. - This is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answer is (B) indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the \"physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature.\" To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.Q: In Passage 2, Grimké makes which point about human rights? Answer Choices: (A)They are viewed differently in various cultures around the world. (B)They retain their moral authority regardless of whether they are recognized by law. (C)They are sometimes at odds with moral responsibilities. (D)They have become more advanced and refined throughout history.\nLet's think step by step.\nIn Passage 2, Grimké discusses human rights in relation to the Anti-Slavery cause and the moral nature of human beings. Let's analyze each answer choice:\n\n(A) They are viewed differently in various cultures around the world.\nGrimké does not discuss cultural differences in the passage.\n\n(B) They retain their moral authority regardless of whether they are recognized by law.\nGrimké states that rights may be taken away from the slave, but they cannot be alienated, and their title to themselves is still perfect (lines 62-65). This suggests that human rights have moral authority even if they are not recognized by law.\n\n(C) They are sometimes at odds with moral responsibilities.\nGrimké does not mention any conflict between human rights and moral responsibilities in the passage.\n\n(D) They have become more advanced and refined throughout history.\nGrimké does not discuss the historical development of human rights in the passage.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (B) They retain their moral authority regardless of whether they are recognized by law.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

In Passage 2, Grimké argues that rights and responsibilities are based on moral nature, not sex, and therefore women have the same moral duties as men. Both authors agree that women have moral duties and responsibilities.\n\n(B) Men often work selflessly for political change.\nNeither passage specifically discusses men working selflessly for political change. This claim cannot be supported by the passages.\n\n(C) The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.\nPassage 1 suggests that women's duties and influence are important, but it does not explicitly state that they are undervalued. Passage 2 focuses on the rights of women and slaves, not on the undervaluation of women's ethical obligations. This claim cannot be supported by the passages.\n\n(D) Political activism is as important for women as it is for men.\nPassage 1 argues that women should not be involved in political activism, as it is outside their appropriate sphere. Passage 2, on the other hand, supports women's involvement in political activism, as it is morally right for them to do so. The authors do not agree on this claim.\n\nBased on the passages, both authors would agree with claim (A) Women have moral duties and responsibilities.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

{"index": 76, "problem_input": "Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. \"Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing,\" says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremit(A)to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \\mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. \"We didn't think this was possible,\" Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. \"Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down.\" 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\\mathrm{V}$.55 \"From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough,\" says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. \"Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before.\"Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance.

(B)unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs. (C)inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality. (D)at odds with the principles of American democracy.\nLet's think step by step.\nFirst, let's analyze the main points of each passage:\n\nPassage 1:\n- Democracy raises women and makes them more equal to men.\n- There are people who want to make men and women not only equal but alike, which the author disagrees with.\n- Americans understand that men and women have distinct roles and should fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner.\n\nPassage 2:\n- Society is moving towards a general principle of just equality.\n- The relationship between men and women is the last to change due to strong emotions associated with it.\n- The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest they can attain, and this can only be determined with complete liberty of choice.\n- Let every occupation be open to all, and employments will fall into the hands of those most capable.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.\nBoth authors mention that society is moving towards greater equality, with Passage 1 mentioning democracy's role in raising women and making them more equal to men, and Passage 2 discussing the general principle of just equality.\n\n(B) unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs.\nNeither author suggests that the changes in gender roles would not provide benefits that outweigh their costs. In fact, both authors seem to argue that these changes would be beneficial.\n\n(C) inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality.\nWhile both authors discuss the importance of gender equality, they do not specifically mention economic advantages as the driving force behind these changes.\n\n(D) at odds with the principles of American democracy.\nPassage 1 specifically mentions that Americans understand the importance of distinct roles for men and women, and Passage 2 does not mention American democracy at all.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (A) part of a broad social shift toward greater equality. Both authors would most likely agree that the changes in gender roles they describe would be part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Answer Choices: (A)Douglas proposes changes to federal policies on slavery, but Lincoln argues that such changes would enjoy no popular support. (B)Douglas expresses concerns about the economic impact of abolition, but Lincoln dismisses those concerns as irrelevant. (C)Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position. (D)Douglas offers an interpretation of federal law that conflicts with Lincoln's, and Lincoln implies that Douglas's interpretation is poorly reasoned. 40\nLet's think step by step.\n(A) Douglas proposes changes to federal policies on slavery, but Lincoln argues that such changes would enjoy no popular support.\n- This choice is not accurate because Douglas does not propose changes to federal policies on slavery; instead, he argues for maintaining the status quo.\n\n(B) Douglas expresses concerns about the economic impact of abolition, but Lincoln dismisses those concerns as irrelevant.\n- This choice is not accurate because neither passage focuses on the economic impact of abolition.\n\n(C) Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position.\n- This choice accurately captures the central tension between the two passages. Douglas criticizes Lincoln for suggesting that the Constitution, which allows for both Free and Slave States, is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand. In response, Lincoln clarifies his position, arguing that the issue is not with the variety of state institutions but with the expansion of slavery into new territories.\n\n(D) Douglas offers an interpretation of federal law that conflicts with Lincoln's, and Lincoln implies that Douglas's interpretation is poorly reasoned.\n- This choice is not accurate because the passages do not focus on interpretations of federal law. Instead, they discuss the broader issue of the Union's sustainability with the existence of both Free and Slave States.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed.

Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap.

When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain openQ: Based on the passage, in studying the Venus flytrap, Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of which type of evidence? Answer Choices: (A)Mathematical models to predict the electrical charge required to close the Venus flytrap (B)Analysis of data collected from previous researchers' work involving the Venus flytrap's response to electricity (C)Information obtained from monitoring the Venus flytrap's response to varying amounts of electrical current\nLet's think step by step.\nBased on the passage, Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of which type of evidence?\n\n(A) Mathematical models to predict the electrical charge required to close the Venus flytrap - The passage does not mention the use of mathematical models by Volkov and his colleagues.\n\n(B) Analysis of data collected from previous researchers' work involving the Venus flytrap's response to electricity - The passage does mention previous research, but it does not specifically state that Volkov and his colleagues extensively analyzed data from previous researchers.\n\n(C) Information obtained from monitoring the Venus flytrap's response to varying amounts of electrical current - The passage describes how Volkov and his colleagues conducted experiments by applying electrical current to the open lobes of the trap and modifying the amount of electrical current to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is (C) Information obtained from monitoring the Venus flytrap's response to varying amounts of electrical current.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, \"Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.\"40 He picked up a bird shape: \"Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought.\" He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: \"Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind.\"As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. \"Look here,\" Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. \"See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this.\" And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. \"The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price.\"I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.Q: The narrator indicates that the contrast between the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village and her family's ink shop is that the ink shop Answer Choices: (A)displays the family's ink more impressively.

Answer Choices: (A)She presents claims in the form of rhetorical questions that mostly have implicit negative answers. (B)She criticizes her opponents by quoting self-contradictory remarks they have made. (C)She illustrates each of her central ideas with an emotionally powerful anecdote. (D)She emphasizes the reasonableness of her views by presenting them as though they are universally held.\nLet's think step by step.\n(A) She presents claims in the form of rhetorical questions that mostly have implicit negative answers.\n\nThroughout the passage, Smith uses rhetorical questions to challenge the idea that women should not be involved in the discussion of slavery. These questions often imply negative answers, suggesting that women do have a role to play in this issue. For example, she asks, \"And is a subject comprehending interests of such magnitude, merely a 'political question,' and one in which woman 'can take no part without losing something of the modesty and gentleness which are her most appropriate ornaments'?\" The implied answer is no, women should not be excluded from discussing such an important issue.\n\n(B) She criticizes her opponents by quoting self-contradictory remarks they have made.\n\nSmith does not directly quote her opponents in the passage, so this statement is not accurate.\n\n(C) She illustrates each of her central ideas with an emotionally powerful anecdote.\n\nWhile Smith does use emotionally charged language to discuss the impact of slavery on families and the nation, she does not provide specific anecdotes to illustrate her points.\n\n(D) She emphasizes the reasonableness of her views by presenting them as though they are universally held.\n\nSmith does not present her views as universally held; instead, she argues against the prevailing belief that women should not be involved in the discussion of slavery.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best description of a technique that Smith uses throughout the passage to advance her main point is (A) She presents claims in the form of rhetorical questions that mostly have implicit negative answers.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

{"index": 109, "problem_input": "\\section{Passage 1}\"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis,\" says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs.

Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet.

The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. \"Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth,\" Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. \"We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment,\" Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 \"standard of care treatment.\" That's going to take five years and $\\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.Q: Information in Passage 2 best supports which conclusion about the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1?

(D)create detailed sketches on which larger artworks are based.\nLet's think step by step.\nThe narrator's talents can be inferred from the passage by looking at the various instances where they showcase their skills or contribute to the ideas being discussed.\n\n(A) There is no mention of the narrator devising imaginative names for the colors of the glass. The names mentioned in the passage are attributed to Tiffany's watercolors.\n\n(B) The narrator does enhance an existing idea by suggesting a new approach to the baptismal font dome, turning it into a lampshade made of translucent glass. This shows their ability to improvise technical innovations for artworks.\n\n(C) The narrator does not provide authoritative critiques of classical artworks in the passage. They do express admiration for Tiffany's work, but this does not indicate a talent for critiquing classical art.\n\n(D) There is no mention of the narrator creating detailed sketches on which larger artworks are based. The sketches and watercolors discussed in the passage are attributed to Tiffany.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the most reasonable inference about the narrator's talents is (B) enhancing an existing idea by improvising technical innovations for artworks.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

{"index": 140, "problem_input": "Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife.

Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.Q: The data in table 2 best support which statement about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey? Answer Choices: (A)At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey. (B)After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether. (C)After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times. (D)None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.\nLet's think step by step.\nBased on the information provided, we can analyze each answer choice:\n\n(A) At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.\n- This statement could be true, as it is mentioned that \"each of these birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice.\" However, we don't have enough information to confirm the exact number of attempts before success.\n\n(B) After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.\n- This statement is not supported by the information provided. It is mentioned that \"after initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method,\" which contradicts the statement.\n\n(C) After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.\n- This statement is not supported by the information provided. It is mentioned that \"after initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method,\" but there is no mention of a specific limit on the number of attempts.\n\n(D) None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.\n- This statement could be true, as it is mentioned that \"five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild,\" which implies that they might have tried different techniques before finding success with the levering technique. However, we don't have enough information to confirm whether they were unsuccessful in their first attempt.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot definitively confirm any of the answer choices. More data from Table 2 would be needed to make an accurate conclusion.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

(B)discuss changes in the perception of the news media as a source of public knowledge. (C)show how journalists’ frames of value influence the production of news stories. (D)challenge the conventional view that news is a form of public knowledge.\nLet's think step by step.\nThe passage discusses the concept of public knowledge and how it is shared through news. It talks about the historical role of newspapers and broadcasters as authoritative sources of public knowledge and how this authority is being questioned in contemporary society. The passage also presents two distinct conceptions of authority and the resistance of some journalists to the democratization of news.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) The passage does not focus on analyzing technological developments affecting the production, circulation, and reception of news stories.\n\n(B) The passage does discuss changes in the perception of the news media as a source of public knowledge, particularly in terms of authority and the democratization of news.\n\n(C) While the passage mentions frames of value and the role of journalists, it does not primarily focus on showing how journalists' frames of value influence the production of news stories.\n\n(D) The passage does not challenge the conventional view that news is a form of public knowledge; rather, it discusses the changing perception of authority in news media.\n\nBased on the analysis, the main purpose of the passage is to:\n\nAnswer: (B) discuss changes in the perception of the news media as a source of public knowledge.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

(B)discuss how laws ought to be enacted and changed in a democracy. (C)advance a view regarding whether individuals should follow all of the country’s laws. (D)articulate standards by which laws can be evaluated as just or unjust.\nLet's think step by step.\nPassage 1 primarily argues that Americans should strictly observe all laws, even if they are bad, and work to change them through legal means rather than resorting to mob law. The author emphasizes the importance of respecting the law as a way to honor the sacrifices made by the founding fathers and maintain the nation's liberty.\n\nPassage 2 acknowledges the existence of unjust laws and questions whether individuals should obey them or work to change them through the existing legal system. The author suggests that if a law requires an individual to commit an injustice against another, they should break the law and act as a counterbalance to the unjust system.\n\nBased on these summaries, the primary purpose of each passage is to:\n\n(C) advance a view regarding whether individuals should follow all of the country's laws.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

The context of the passage is about the growth of solar panel installations, the challenges faced by the manufacturing industry, and the optimism in the industry for long-term prospects.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) express concern about the limitations of a material.\nThe last sentence does not express concern about limitations; instead, it highlights the reduction in cost.\n\n(B) identify a hurdle that must be overcome.\nThe sentence does not identify a hurdle; it shows progress in reducing the cost of solar panels.\n\n(C) make a prediction about the effective use of certain devices.\nThe sentence does not make a prediction about the use of devices; it only states the current cost situation.\n\n(D) introduce a potential new area of study.\nThe sentence does not introduce a new area of study; it provides information about the cost reduction of existing technology.\n\nNone of the answer choices seem to fit perfectly with the last sentence. However, if we must choose one, the closest option would be:\n\n(B) identify a hurdle that must be overcome.\n\nThis is because the reduction in cost can be seen as overcoming a hurdle (high cost) that could have limited the growth and adoption of solar panels.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}
