If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A)300 (B)500 (C)5000 (D)6000 (E)7500\nLet's think step by step.\nFirst, we need to find the proportion of tagged deer in the second year's sample. We know that 20 out of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year. So, the proportion of tagged deer in the sample is:\n\n20 tagged deer / 500 total deer = 0.04 (or 4%)\n\nNow, we assume that this proportion (4%) is representative of the entire deer population in the forest. We also know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, and this number represents 4% of the total deer population. To find the total deer population, we can set up a proportion:\n\n(tagged deer in 2001) / (total deer population) = 0.04\n300 / (total deer population) = 0.04\n\nNow, we can solve for the total deer population:\n\ntotal deer population = 300 / 0.04\ntotal deer population = 7500\n\nSo, the total deer population in the forest is 7500. The correct answer is (E) 7500.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

One of the integers is 350.\n\nStep 2: Use the relationship between GCF, LCM, and the product of the two integers\nThe product of two integers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. In other words, if the two integers are a and b, then:\n\na * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b)\n\nStep 3: Substitute the given values into the equation\nWe know that one of the integers (a) is 350, the GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. So, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n350 * b = 11 * 7700\n\nStep 4: Solve for the other integer (b)\nNow, we need to solve for the other integer (b):\n\n350 * b = 84700\n\nTo find b, divide both sides of the equation by 350:\n\nb = 84700 / 350\nb = 242\n\nSo, the other integer is 242.\n\nAnswer: (A) 242\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

Let the cost price of the book be x.\n\nProfit = Selling Price - Cost Price\n10% of x = Rs 27.50 - x\n0.10x = 27.50 - x\n1.10x = 27.50\nx = 27.50 / 1.10\nx = 25\n\nSo, the cost price of the book is Rs 25.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the profit or loss when the book is sold for Rs 25.75.\nNew Selling Price = Rs 25.75\nProfit or Loss = New Selling Price - Cost Price\nProfit or Loss = 25.75 - 25\nProfit or Loss = 0.75\n\nSince the value is positive, it indicates a profit of Rs 0.75.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the percentage of profit or loss.\nPercentage of Profit or Loss = (Profit or Loss / Cost Price) * 100\nPercentage of Profit = (0.75 / 25) * 100\nPercentage of Profit = 3%\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 3% Profit.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, 2) = n! / (2!(n-2)!), where n! represents the factorial of n.\n\nNow, we know that there are 45 different ways to choose two balls without selecting the ball marked with the number 3. This means that we need to subtract the number of ways to choose two balls that include the ball marked with the number 3 from the total number of ways to choose two balls.\n\nIf we include the ball marked with the number 3, there are (n-1) ways to choose the second ball. So, the number of ways to choose two balls without selecting the ball marked with the number 3 is C(n, 2) - (n-1).\n\nWe are given that this value is 45, so we can set up the equation:\n\nC(n, 2) - (n-1) = 45\n\nNow, we can substitute the combination formula into the equation:\n\nn! / (2!(n-2)!) - (n-1) = 45\n\nWe can test each answer choice to see which one satisfies the equation:\n\n(A) n = 11\nC(11, 2) - (11-1) = 55 - 10 = 45\n\n(B) n = 10\nC(10, 2) - (10-1) = 45 - 9 = 36\n\n(C) n = 9\nC(9, 2) - (9-1) = 36 - 8 = 28\n\n(D) n = 8\nC(8, 2) - (8-1) = 28 - 7 = 21\n\n(E) n = 7\nC(7, 2) - (7-1) = 21 - 6 = 15\n\nOnly answer choice (A) satisfies the equation, so the value of n is 11.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}

J = 2S - F\n\nWe can substitute equation (3) into equation (2) to eliminate J:\n\nF = S + (2S - F)\n\nNow solve for F:\n\n2F = 3S\nF = 3S/2\n\nNow substitute equation (3) into equation (1) to eliminate J:\n\n(2S - F) + S + F = 100\n\nSimplify and solve for S:\n\n3S = 100\nS = 100/3 ≈ 33.33 (but age must be an integer, so this is not possible)\n\nSince S must be an integer, we can conclude that F must be an even number. Let's test the even answer choices:\n\n(A) F = 45 (not even, skip)\n(B) F = 48\n(C) F = 50\n(D) F = 55 (not even, skip)\n(E) F = 58\n\nFor (B) F = 48:\nFrom equation (2), J = 2S - F = 2S - 48\nFrom equation (1), J + S + F = 100, so S = 100 - J - F = 100 - J - 48 = 52 - J\nNow, 2S - 48 = 52 - J, so J = 48 - 2S\nSince J must be a positive integer, S must be less than 24. The largest possible value for S is 23, which gives J = 2. However, this does not satisfy the condition in equation (2) that F = S + J. So, F = 48 is not a valid solution.\n\nFor (C) F = 50:\nFrom equation (2), J = 2S - F = 2S - 50\nFrom equation (1), J + S + F = 100, so S = 100 - J - F = 100 - J - 50 = 50 - J\nNow, 2S - 50 = 50 - J, so J = 50 - 2S\nSince J must be a positive integer, S must be less than 25. The largest possible value for S is 24, which gives J = 2. This satisfies the condition in equation (2) that F = S + J. So, F = 50 is a valid solution.\n\nFor (E) F = 58:\nFrom equation (2), J = 2S - F = 2S - 58\nFrom equation (1), J + S + F = 100, so S = 100 - J - F = 100 - J - 58 = 42 - J\nNow, 2S - 58 = 42 - J, so J = 58 - 2S\nSince J must be a positive integer, S must be less than 29. The largest possible value for S is 28, which gives J = 2. However, this does not satisfy the condition in equation (2) that F = S + J. So, F = 58 is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the age of Joe's father is 50 years old, and the correct answer is (C) 50.\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is"}
